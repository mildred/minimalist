Virtual Domains and Minimalist
------------------------------

Here is a short manual how to set up MINImalist MAiling LIST manager, with
virtual domains. Minimalist (http://www.mml.org.ua/) is a mailing tool
programmed by Vladimir Litovka. Note, that MTA-specific part is about
sendmail - the oldest (Vladimir Litovka says: "This doesn't mean it is
better ;)") MTA in the universe.

First off all set up all your lists you want. For that check the minimalist
manual. In this example we created the lists "list-one" and "list-two".
First list is for the domain list-one@domain1.com and second - for
list-two@domain2.com.

Add these lines into your /etc/mail/aliases file. Don't forget to run
newaliases after that.

minimalist:             "|/usr/local/sbin/minimalist.pl"
list-one:               "|/usr/local/sbin/minimalist.pl list-one"
list-two:		"|/usr/local/sbin/minimalist.pl list-two"

Next step is to edit the /etc/mail/virtusertable. Just add the 
two aliases into your file.

# LIST ONE
minimalist@domain1.com			minimalist
list-one@domain1.com              	list-one
list-one-owner@domain1.com		admin@domain1.com

# LIST TWO
minimalist@domain2.com			minimalist
list-two@domain2.com			list-two
list-two-owner@domain2.com		admin@domain2.com

After that, just run in your /etc/mail direcotry 
     makemap hash virtusertable < virtusertable
and all should work fine.

Don't forget to edit the config file for each list. Don't forget set
correct domains for each list. This can be done in every local list's
config, directive 'domain'. It would be like this:

for list-one: domain = domain1.com
and for list-two: domain = domain2.com

I personally tested it on S.u.S.E. Linux 5.3 and there it works 
fine. If there are any problems or questions or comments mail me
