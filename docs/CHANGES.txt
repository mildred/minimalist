Minimalist 2.5(1.4)		(Mar 24, 2004)

    the following format: {pwd: list_password}. See README for further
    details
 . Minimialist now doesn't produce MIME message, if there isn't footer for the
    list
 . Fixed stupid typo: header X-Been-There changed for X-BeenThere for
    compatibility with Mailman

Minimalist 2.5(1.2)		(Mar 03, 2004)

 . Fixed bug, which leads to truncate some incoming message
 . Fixed broken loop handling

Minimalist 2.5(1)		(Feb 21, 2004)

 There are many functional changes, author recommends all to read file README
 before using Minimalist. Yes, it is mostly back compatible, but not always.

 . New commands: mode, suspend, resume, maxsize.
 . Batched processing (one or more commands in body of message).
 . Work around MIME-encoded messages when adding footer to outgoing message.
 
 . Added directive 'log messages' - log information about messages (From,
    size, Subject, etc).
 . Added directive 'archive size' - it sets maximum size of message, which
    will be archived.
 . Added directive 'charset' - it defines charset, used in information
    messages (from Minimalist itself) and footer. See README in part III.3.b,
    where dances around footer are explained.

Minimalist 2.4			(Jule 14, 2003)

 . Added directive 'background', which allows to detach Minimalist from MTA
    and run in background.
 . Added command-line option "-c", which specifies configuration file for
    Minimalist.
 . Minimalist now preserves original To: and Cc: headers, but
    unconditionally removes original Reply-To: header.
 . Directive 'maxrcpts' now has bounds: from 1 to 50.
 
Minimalist 2.3(3.3)		(June 29, 2003)

 . Fixed security hole, which allows to execute some commands on host where
    Minimalist works.
 . Added directive 'list gecos'.
 . Fixed bug, when single '.' in message treated as end of message.
 
Minimalist 2.3(3)		(June 5, 2003)

 . Added directive 'remove resent', see minimalist.conf-sample for more
    information.
 . Expanded directive errors_to - it is possible to use there arbitrary
    E-mail, not only 'drop', 'admin' and 'sender'.
 . Added report of count of subscribers, when requesting subscribers list.
 . Fixed few bugs

Minimalist 2.3(1)		(???)
 
 . Code reworked to support internationalization. This is done by Volker
    Tanger, thanks to him for this great work.
 . New directive 'extra header'. Can be used for add extra headers to
    message. See description in minimalist.conf-sample
 . Changed sorting criteria of recipients list. Now Minimalist sorts it by
    domains, which will speed up sending of message.

Minimalist 2.2(4.3)

 . Fixed bug, which appears when processing unsubscribe requests on full
    filesystem. In such case Minimalist was drop subscription list. Thanks
    to Lars J. Aas for pointing to this problem.
 
Minimalist 2.2(4.2)		(May 7, 2002)

 . Added stripping of various "Return Request" headers. Currently there
    are: Return-Receipt-To, Disposition-Notification-To,
    X-Confirm-Reading-To.
 . Enhanced directive "blacklist" - it is more reliable now. See
    minimalist.conf-sample for further explanation.
 . Added directory contrib/ where useful supporting software can be found.

Minimalist 2.2(4)		(February 9, 2002)

 . Added support for RFC 2369 headers in outgoing message (information
    about subscription/unsubscription/etc).
 . Fixed small uncritical bug in handling GECOS pattern.
 . Added directory docs/FAQ/ - there are most often questions and answers.

Minimalist 2.2(3)		(September 20, 2001)

 . If sender uses GECOS in listname - for example:

    To: My Cool List <listname@some.domain>

    then Minimalist saves it and fills 'To:' header in outgoing message
    with this value. Whistle, of course, but so pretty :)

Minimalist 2.2(2)		(March 5, 2001)

 . Added directive 'delay'. It defines pause between calls to sendmail and
    with 'maxrcpts' can be used for slow down process of generating
    messages.
 . Added directive 'from' - it is possible to set 'From:' header of
    outgoing mail to some predefined value.

Minimalist 2.2			(October 25, 2000)

 . Added support for external delivery of processed message. Check new
    directive 'delivery' in minimalist.conf-sample. Useful when using bulk
    mailers (for example ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/moore/bulk_mailer/)
 . Added support for write-only subscribe. If user sends request with
    suffix '-writers' in list name, he will be able to send messages to
    list, but will receive nothing from list.

Minimalist 2.1(2)		(October 3, 2000)

 . Fixed security hole, which affects all versions of Minimalist - if
    spammer uses "|" at the end of From: header, he can write to list even
    if this list closed or he doesn't subscribed to it.
 . Fixed typo in code, which support authentication for subscribe and
    unsubscribe requests.
 . Added functionality to "domain" directive - it is possible to call
    external program (for determine domain name) by prepending "|" before
    program name.
 . Changed default admin's email - it is now postmaster@primary_domain (was
    root@primary_domain)
 . Removed "-w" key from Perl's command line.

Minimalist 2.1 (Patience)	(September 22, 2000)

 Changes from RC are minimal:

  . Added '-d <path_to_conf>' directive, which points to directory, where
     is main configuration file (minimalist.conf) located.
  . If domain doesn't contain a dot, Minimalist tries to use "domainname"
     command to add domain to hostname. It is useful for SunOS system.
  . Added "Precedence: list" header to message. It used by vacation and
     similar programs for identify mails from robots.
  . Added check for SysV-style "From " header in message. It is used (among
     with other methods) for preventing robot wars.

Minimalist 2.1RC (Barcelona)	(***************)
 
 There are couple of changes, which users should note:

 . License has changed from GPL to BSD. This license is more free for
    developers and the same, as GPL, for end users.
 . Directive 'auth valid' has changed to 'request valid'.
 . Directive 'trusted' removed - see description for new directive 'auth'
    below.
 . Logfile's format has changed.
 . Prior to version 2.0.2 Minimalist didn't adding header 'Sender:' if
    there wasn't this header in original message. In 2.0.2 this was changed
    to add it (see last item in the announce for 2.0.2 below) and now this
    feature completely removed as quite unuseful.
 . Administrator can write to the list even if he isn't member of the list.
 . Directive 'list' (it was aliased to 'who') removed.

 There are changes to authentication scheme for administrative requests. As
 said above, directive 'trusted' removed. New scheme is: there is global
 administrative password - it gives ability to make administrative requests
 and changes to all lists, hosted on particular server (directive
 'password' in global configuration file). For lists there is new directive
 'auth' - see minimalist.conf-sample for syntax.

 
Minimalist 2.0.2 (Banana) (November 6, 1999)

 . Added directive 'maxsize'. It limits maximum message size, including
    headers.
 . Added directive 'errors to'. All error messages from MTA can be dropped
    (default behaviour) or can be sent to administrator or sender of
    original message. See minimalist.conf-sample for further details.
 . Added some paranoid checks for revealing administrator's errors.
 . Slightly changed behaviour, when replying with authentication request:
    command 'auth' now appears in a subject of message, so user can just do
    Reply, without ugly cut-n-paste from body to subject.
 . If there isn't 'Sender' header in original message, Minimalist creates
    it in the final message and fills it with value from 'From' header.

Minimalist 2.0.1 (Black Sea) (August 22, 1999)

    creation. Thanks to Jerome Mouton for pointing to this

Minimalist 1.3.3 (March 17, 1999)

 . Subscribers don't want to receive rejects from remote mailers due
    to miscellaneous delivery failures, do it? They now will not
    receive rejects.
 . Changed behaviour of 'modify subject' directive. It is less aggressive
    by default. Value 'more' makes modification more deep. See
    minimalist.conf-sample for details.
