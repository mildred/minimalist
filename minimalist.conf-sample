############## Main configuration file for Minimalist ################

#--------------------------------------------------------------------#
#          These directives can be used only in global config        #
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#

# The directory for Minimalist's files - default to /var/spool/minimalist
#
#directory = /var/spool/minimalist

# Administrator password. It applies to all lists, regardless to
# authentication settings in these lists. For per-list authentication see
# directive 'auth' below.
#
# Password must be in very first line and first column of message's body,
# as follows (without quotes): '*password: this_secret_password'
#
# By default this password isn't empty, but undefined, so if you want use
# it, you must define it here.
#
#password = this_secret_password

# Time while authentication request is valid, in hours
# Default to 24 hours
#
#request valid = 12

# Access control list, used for limiting access to Minimalist. Delimiter
# for items is ':'. Item, which begins with '@', means path to filename
# with items list, one item per row.
#
# Default is empty
#
#blacklist = !small.domain.com:domain.com:spamdomain.org:@/path/to/blacklist.txt
#
# In this example mails from small.domain.com will be allowed to work with
# Minimalist, mails from domain.com will be disallowed, and further, on the
# 'first match' basis.

# Robots (like MLM=mailing list managers) usually should be blocked
# otherwise two minimalists could be ping-ponging help/subscribe messages
# to each other infinitely. Delimiter is '|'.
#
#blocked robots = 'X-List-Server|List-Id|List-Subscribe|X-Yahoo-Newman-Property';

# Log requests to Minimalist. Can be either "none" or path to logfile.
#
# Default to none
#
#logfile = /var/log/Minimalist.log

# Log info about messages, passed through Minimalist. Can be 'yes' or 'no'
#
# Default to 'no'. logfile (see above) to 'none' implies 'no'
#
#log messages = yes

# Run in background. If 'yes', Minimalist uses fork for detach from MTA and
# continues execution in background.
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#background = yes

#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
#  These directives can be used either in global and local configs  #
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#

# The Minimalist administrator's e-mail address.
#
# Default to postmaster@primary_domain, where primary_domain is the result
# of the `hostname --fqdn` command
#
#admin = doka@kiev.sovam.com

# Address for return miscellaneous delivery errors
#
# Available values are:
# . drop - drop such error messages
# . admin - send error messages to admin (see above)
# . sender - send error messages to sender of original message
# . verp - generate VERP (see below)
# . RFC-822 E-mail - send error messages to arbitrary mailbox
#
# Default to 'drop'. Note, that 'sender' value is quite annoying for
# message's sender and highly undesirable. When setuping new list it is
# desirable to set this parameter to 'admin' for revealing adimistrator's
# errors.
#
# Note about 'verp' (Variable Envelope Return Path).
#
# Prepare message so, that it will be possible to parse bounce messages.
# For detailed description see original document at
# http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt
# or it's copy at
# http://www.mml.org.ua/verp.txt
#
# You must create one additional alias in your 'aliases' file, for
# processing bounce messages. It must be something similar to:
#
#listname-owner-*:	"|/path/to/bouncer.pl"
#
# where 'listname' is the name of mailing list. Wildcard mask specifies,
# that any message, where recipient's address starts on 'listname-owner-',
# will be passed to bouncer.pl. Check your MTA documentation on how to
# creare wilcard aliases.
#
# Distribution of Minimalist does not provide bounce processing program.
# You should use any third-party program.
#
# CAUTION: if value set to 'verp', Minimalist will generate ONE MESSAGE per
# RECIPIENT. On big lists this can produce very big load of server.
#
#errors to = admin

# The list's language
# en=English / ru=Russian / de=informal German / DE=formal German /
# NL=Dutch
#
# See contrib/languages directory for further information
#
# language = en

# The charset, which will be used in information messages and footer.
#
# Default is 'us-ascii'
#
# See docs/README for information on how Minimalist adds footer,
# dependently on charset.
#
#charset = koi8-r

# Path to sendmail, default to '/usr/sbin/sendmail'
#
#sendmail = /usr/sbin/sendmail

# Delivery method. Can be 'internal' - Minimalist will send message by
# itself and 'alias' - Minimalist will send message to specified address,
# which can points to bulkmailer, etc.
#
# Note, that using 'alias' automatically sets value of 'errors to' to
# 'sender'.
#
# Default to 'internal'. Syntax is:
#
#delivery = internal
#delivery = alias e-mail

# The domain name - default to `hostname --fqdn`. If begins with '|' then
# Minimalist calls external program to determine hostname.
#
#domain = |uname -n
#domain = kiev.sovam.com

# Security level:
# . none - allow any person write to any mailing list
# . careful - only subscribers can write to list
# . paranoid - user must authenticate subscribe/unsubscribe requests
#
# Default to 'careful'
#
#security = none

# Archiving strategy:
#  . no - don't archive articles
#  . daily - create new directory for articles every day
#  . monthly - create new directory for articles every month
#  . yearly - create new directory for articles every year
# or
#  archive = pipe /path/to/archiver [options]
#
# for instance
#  archive = pipe /usr/local/bin/hypermail -m www-talk -d /archives/www-talk
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#archive = monthly

# Maximum size of message (in bytes), which will be archived
#
# Default - zero (no limits)
#
#archive size = 1000000

# List's status. Available values are:
# . open - list without any restrictions
# . ro - read-only access to list
# . closed - only trusted users can subscribe anyone to this list.
# . mandatory - subscribed users can't unsubscribe
#
# Values may be used together, for example: closed,ro,mandatory
#
# Default to 'open'
#
#status = closed,ro,mandatory

# Copy to sender - indicates send or no message to message's sender
# Default to yes
#
#copy to sender = no

# This variable defines Reply-To: contents of outgoing message. Available
# choices: 'no', 'yes' or e-mail. If used 'no' (default), Minimalist doesn't
# touch this header at all. If used 'yes', Minimalist sets Reply-To: header
# to list's address instead of original contents.
# 
# The third choice is available ONLY in per-list config - if used any other
# value, Reply-To: will be set to this value. BE CAREFUL and use correct
# RFC-822 compliant E-mail here.
#
# Please check the following URL on why you (most often) should not use
# this feature: http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html (Thanks to
# Jonas Bofjall for pointing to this topic)
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#reply-to list = yes

# Set From: to specified value (RFC-822 compliant E-mail address) in
# outgoing message.
#
# Default - don't touch From:
#
#from = doka@kiev.sovam.com

# Modify subject before sending message to subscribers.
#
# Available values:
#  no   : don't touch subject
#  yes  : add "[list_name] " before original subject
#  more : remove leading "Re: " if it's there and then add "[list_name] "
#
# Default to yes
#
#modify subject = no

# Maximal count of subscribers per list, zero means no limits.
# Default to zero
#
#maxusers = 100

# Count of recipients per message. If not zero, Minimalist will generate
# few messages with maxrcpts recipients instead of one message to all
# recipients.
#
# Allowed value from 1 to 50, default to 10
#
# Be careful when using high values, because this may lead to lost some
# recipients in mailing if total length of addresses will exceed allowed
# length of command line, passed to MTA.
#
#maxrcpts = 15

# Delay (in seconds) between deliveries, if there are few ones per message.
#
# Default to none
#
#delay = 15

# Maximal size of message
# Default to none
#
#maxsize = 100000

# Include list information headers (RFC 2369) in outgoing mail. These
# directives are: List-Help, List-Subscribe, List-Unsubscribe, List-Post,
# List-Owner and, optionally, List-Archive.
#
# Available values are: 'no', 'yes' or URL, which points to archive, in
# form: <URL> (Comment)
#
# Example:
# list information = <http://www.yahoo.com/> (Archive of everything)
#
# Note: comment is optional and may be avoided. Using URL as value in this
# directive implies 'yes' to all rest List-* headers and available only in
# per-list config.
#
# Default value is 'yes'
#
#list information = no

# Strip various "Receipt Request" headers. Currently there are:
#
#  . Return-Receipt-To
#  . Disposition-Notification-To
#  . X-Confirm-Reading-To
#
# Default not to strip
#
#strip rrq = yes

# Add extra headers. It is possible to use this option two and more times -
# Minimalist will glue all these headers, when producing final message.
# Also it is possible to use macroses (if applicable) \a (admin), \d
# (domain), \l (list), \o (owner), \n (newline), \t (tab) and \s (space) in
# these headers.
#
# WARNING! Minimalist doesn't check validity of these headers nor their
# duplicating! Be carefull while using this option.
#
#extra header = X-BeenThere: \l@\d
#
# By using \n, \t and \s it is possible to construct multiline headers, for
# example:
#
#extra header = X-Multline: first line\n\t second line\n\t third line
#
# the same result may be achieved by combining few directives:
#
#extra header = X-Multilne: first line
#extra header = \t second line
#extra header = \t third line

# Remove 'Resent-*' headers in incoming mail. These headers are not
# important for message understanding and processing, but some MUA's
# generate incorrect these ones.
#
# Default not to remove.
#
#remove resent = yes

# Modify Message-ID in outgoing message.
#
# If somefirstbody subscribed on two lists on same server and
# somesecondbody crossposts message to these lists and
# somefirstbody's MTA doesn't allow two and more messages with
# same Message-ID, then this first body will receive message only
# once. In this case modification of original message's Message-ID
# will solve this problem.
#
# Modification is done by adding token 'MMLID_xxxxx-' before the
# original Message-ID, where xxxxx is some number between 0 and 99999
#
# Default do not touch Message-ID.
#
#modify message-id = yes

# Send message on subscribe/unsubscribe event to list owner
#
# Default to no
#
#cc on subscribe = yes

#------------------------------------------------------------------#
#       These directives can be used in local configs only         #
#------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Authentication scheme for list.
#
# NOTE: By default there is 'password' scheme with undefined password, so
# if you want to make administrative requests to list, you must define this
# scheme explicitly.
#
# Examples:
#
# auth = mailfrom doka@kiev.sovam.com:@/usr/local/etc/list.admins
#	List users, allowed to make administrative requests. Their e-mails
#	delimited by ':', item, beginnig with '@' means filename with list
#	of persons, one person's e-mail per one row.
#
# auth = password this_secret_password
#	Password, which opens administrative access to list. Must be in
#	very first line and first column of message's body, as follows
#	(without quotes): '*password: this_secret_password'
#
#auth = mailfrom doka@kiev.sovam.com:@/usr/local/etc/mml.trusted
#auth = password this_secret_password

# List's GECOS.
#
# Add gecos to headers 'To' and, optionally, 'Reply-To', when sending
# message to subscribers. For example, using:
#
# list gecos = Minimalist General Discussion
#
# will produce
#
# To: Minimalist General Discussion <mml-general@kiev.sovam.com>
# Reply-To: Minimalist General Discussion <mml-general@kiev.sovam.com>
#
# in outgoing message.
#
# Default: empty
#
#list gecos = Test GECOS

# Fill header 'To' of outgoing message with recipient's address.
#
# Note: if set to 'yes', Minimalist will remove all rest 'To' and 'Cc'
# headers from message.
#
# CAUTION: if set to 'yes', Minimalist will generate ONE MESSAGE per
# RECIPIENT. On big lists this can produce very big load of server.
#
# Default to 'no'
#
#to recipient = yes
